# My Data Projects

Some of the things I do in MATLAB I think are kind of cool. I have been coding in MATLAB since 2012 and I want to put some of the work I have done here whenever its something I had to figure out that migth be helpful later. Most of my MATLAB skills are from many iterations adapting solutions coming from stack.exchange and other coding forums - as well as the MATLAB forum.  Hopefully over time I will be able to archive more and more projects here.
